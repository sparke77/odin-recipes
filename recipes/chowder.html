        <p>Did you say dish? Chowder's not a dish, windbag. It's a way of life, a state of being, man's one perfect achievement. What did the Native Americans serve to the pilgrims. Chowder. What did Marie de La Tourette scream to the ravels? Let them eat Chowder. What did Neil Armstrong say when he landed on the moon? That's one small slice of, Chowder. It's not a dish, It's the stuff of dreams. It's the food of the gods. It's what's for lunch.</p>

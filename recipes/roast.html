        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Did you say dish? Pork roast's not a dish, windbag. It's a way of life, a state of being, man's one perfect achievement. What did the Native Americans serve to the pilgrims. Pork roast. What did Marie de La Tourette scream to the ravels? Let them eat pork roast. What did Neil Armstrong say when he landed on the moon? That's one small slice of, pork roast. It's not a dish. It's the stuff of dreams. It's the food of the gods. It's what's for lunch.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2lbs pork roast</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons coarse ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Rinse roast under cold running water to wet exterior. Pat dry. Use a brush or paper towel to spread Worcestershire sauce evenly over the exterior. Season roast with pepper, salt, steak seasoning, onion powder and garlic powder on all sides.</li>
            <li>Place roast fat-side up into a shallow roasting pan and place on the middle rack in the oven</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until cooked to desire doneness, 20 minutes for medium, 24 minutes for medium-well, or 28 minutes for well done. Turn off the oven and leave roast in the oven, without opening the door, for an additional 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes to allow juices to settle back down into the roast. Slice thinly and serve.</li>
        </ol>
